Computational Thinking Project: Order Management System

This project, undertaken as an assignment for a module during my bachelor's degree at University Academy 92, focuses on applying computational thinking to design algorithms for Jiraya Industries, a safety products company. The three algorithms developed are for creating, deleting, and modifying orders, forming a basic order management system aligned with the company's requirements.

Later, Jiraya Industries undergoes a transition and is acquired by Tanjiro Safety Products. Consequently, Tanjiro seeks to update the system's requirements, necessitating changes to the existing algorithms to meet the new specifications.

Furthermore, Tanjiro expresses interest in evaluating the resource efficiency of the second algorithm developed compared to the initial version.

This project serves as an exploration of computational thinking principles in real-world application scenarios within the domain of order management systems for safety product companies.
