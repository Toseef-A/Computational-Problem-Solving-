The aim for this project is to use computational thinking to design algorithms for Jiraya Industries that sells safety products. The 3 algorithms used were create order, delete order, and modify order. These orders would make up a simple order management system with the requirements asked by the company. Later, the Jiraya industries is taken over by Tanjiro Safety Products. Tanjiro now wants to change the requirements which would mean that the three algorithms would also need to be changed to satisfy the new requirements. After a while, Tanjiro would like to compare if the second algorithm made is more resource efficient.
